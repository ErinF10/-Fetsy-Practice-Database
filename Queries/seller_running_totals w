Create a stored procedure called seller_running_totals which accepts a seller name and returns the seller_id, order_id, order_date, 
order_total. Also show a running sales total (in terms of money) for that seller over all time (hint: windowing functions) under 
the column running_total. The running total should increase with each sale made.
