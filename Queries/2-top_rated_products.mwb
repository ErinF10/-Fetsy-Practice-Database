Create a view called top_rated_products which displays the product_id, product_name, product_price, avg_rating and rating_count for 
the top ten products according to their average rating (minimum of 20 ratings).

DROP VIEW top_rated_products;
CREATE VIEW top_rated_products

	FROM products, orders
    WHERE orders.product_id = products.product_id
    GROUP BY products.product_id
	HAVING rating_count > 20
	ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
    LIMIT 10;
