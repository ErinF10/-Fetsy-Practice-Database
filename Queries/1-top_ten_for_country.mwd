Queries:
Create a stored procedure called top_ten_for_country which accepts the name of a country and returns the buyer_id, first_name,
last_name, and total_amount_spent for the top ten buyers (in terms of total amount of money spent) for that country. 
Make sure to do an unnecessary join to another table

-- We can do an INNER JOIN on the tables because there will never be NULL values except in the case of a product without an order,
-- we are never going to look at products without orders though.
